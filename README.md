# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

This project will create all of the required infrastructure in Azure programatically. The resoureces in the TDD environment will be torn down after automated testing is completed. The UAT and Prod resources will remain. There is an Octopus variable **EnsureEnvironmentsExist** that will tell Octopus to create all of the resources. If the variable is set to **True** Octopus will create all of the resources, if the variable is set to something else, Octopus will not create the resources. **EnsureEnvironmentsExist** should always be set to **True** for the TDD environment. This variable should be set to **False** (or anything other than **True**) for UAT and Prod to save time and preserve the existing resources during subsequent deployments.

# Octopus Deploy Runbook Setup:

In the ChurchBulletin.Scripts package that is created there is a script called ScaleInfrastructure.ps1. When provided with appReplicas and/or serviceObjective values the script will set the min and max number of replicas of the container app and the service objective of the database. This is used with Octopus Runbooks ([Runbooks Documentation](https://octopus.com/docs/runbooks#:~:text=To%20create%20or%20manage%20your,%E2%9E%9C%20Runbooks%20%E2%9E%9C%20Add%20Runbook.)) to scale up and down the infrastructure for day and nighttime loads.

## Create ContainerAppReplicas variable

In your Octopus Deploy project, create two new variables
- **ContainerAppScaledUpReplicas** and give it an integer value. e.g. 2
- **ContainerAppScaledUpCPU** and give it a float value. e.g. 0.5
- **ContainerAppScaledUpMem** and give it a float value. e.g. 1.0
- **DBScaledUpPerformanceLevel** and give it service objective value. e.g. S0

Commit these variables to main. **Variables not in the default branch will not be accessible to runbooks**

![Alt text](images/Replicas1.png)

## Create Scale Up Runbook

- In your Octopus Deploy project, navigate to Operations -> Runbooks and select ADD RUNBOOK
- Name the runbook Scale Up Infrastructure
- Select Save
![Alt text](images/runbook1.png)

- Select DEFINE YOUR RUNBOOK PROCESS near the upper right

![Alt text](images/runbook2.png)

- And then select ADD STEP

- Use the run az Azure Script step template

![Alt text](images/runbook3.png)

- Select ADD

- Name the step **Scale Up Infrastructure**
- Leave Execution Location, Worker Pool, Container Image, and Azure Tools as default

- Under Azure -> Account select the chain links icon to bind the account value to a variable. Then set the value to **#{AzureAccount}** 

![Alt text](images/runbook4.png)

- Under Script Source select **Script file inside a package** 
- Under Script File in Package set the Package feed to the feed that was created.
- Set the Package ID to **ChurchBulletin.Script**
- Set the Script file name to **ScaleInfrastructure.ps1**
- Set the Script parameters to **-appReplicas #{ContainerAppScaledUpReplicas} -cpu #{ContainerAppScaledUpCPU} -mem #{ContainerAppScaledUpMem} -serviceObjective #{DBScaledUpPerformanceLevel}**

![Alt text](images/runbook5.png)

Leave the rest of the settings at default, and select SAVE

## Create Scale Down Runbook

Create another runbook named Scale Down Container App using the same directions.

- Change the Step Name to **Scale Down Infrastructure**
- Leave the Script Parameters blank

## Publish the runbooks

Runbooks must be published before they can be consumed by triggers.

- Navigate to the Scale Up Infrastructure runbook. Select PUBLISH
![Alt text](images/runbook6.png)
- Leave the default settings, and select PUBLISH
![Alt text](images/runbook7.png)
- Do the same for Scale Down Infrastructure

## Create Scheduled Runbook Triggers
([Runbook Triggers Documentation](https://octopus.com/docs/runbooks/scheduled-runbook-trigger))

- Navigate to Operations -> Triggers
- Select ADD SCHEDULED TRIGGER
- Name the trigger Scale Up Morning
- Under Runbook select Scale Up Infrastructure
- Under Target Environments select Prod
- Leave the schedule at Daily
- Under Run Days uncheck Saturday and Sunday
- Set Schedule Timezone to your timezone
- Leave the Interval at once
- Set the Start Time to 8:00 AM
- Click Save

![Alt text](images/trigger1.png)

- Create another trigger named Scale Down Evening
- Use the Scale Down Container App runbook
- Under Target Environments select Prod
- Under Run Days uncheck Saturday and Sunday
- Set Schedule Timezone to your timezone
- Set the Start Time to 6:00 PM
- Click Save

Now the container app and database will automatically be scaled up every morning, and scaled down every evening
