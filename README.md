# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

This project will create all of the required infrastructure in Azure programatically. The resoureces in the TDD environment will be torn down after automated testing is completed. The UAT and Prod resources will remain. There is an Octopus variable **EnsureEnvironmentsExist** that will tell Octopus to create all of the resources. If the variable is set to **True** Octopus will create all of the resources, if the variable is set to something else, Octopus will not create the resources. **EnsureEnvironmentsExist** should always be set to **True** for the TDD environment. This variable should be set to **False** (or anything other than **True**) for UAT and Prod to save time and preserve the existing resources during subsequent deployments.

Requirements:

- Octopus Deploy
- Azure
- Azure DevOps
- Github

This project is configured to work with either Azure DevOps Pipelines or Github Actions. It cannot work with both at the same time.
Follow the [Github](#github),[Azure](#azure),[Octopus Deploy Environment Setup:](#octopus-deploy-environment-setup) and [Octopus Deploy Project Setup:](#octopus-deploy-project-setup) steps at the beginning of this document, then:
- If using Azure DevOps, follow the steps in the [Azure DevOps Setup:](#azure-devops-setup) section
- If using Github Actions, follow the steps in the [Github Actions Setup:](#github-actions-setup) section
 
# Github
Fork the [onion-architecture-dotnet-7-container-apps](https://github.com/ClearMeasureLabs/onion-architecture-dotnet-7-container-apps) repo
# Azure

## Create an Azure Container Registry

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal?tabs=azure-cli](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal?tabs=azure-cli)

Name the resource group something identifiable and different than the application environments. 
e.g. onion-architecture-container-apps-acr
The resource groups for the application environments will be created and destroyed programatically, the container registry should be kept separate.

When creating the container registry, a Basic SKU is sufficient. Name the container registry something identifiable. e.g. onion-architecture-container-apps

## Connect Azure to Octopus Deploy

### Create an Azure App Registration for Octopus Deploy

- In Azure AD select App Registrations

![Alt text](images/Create%20azure%20app%20registration%201.png)

- Select New Registration
    1. Name the Registration something identifiable. e.g. Onion-Containers-Octo
    2. A Redirect URI is not needed
    3. Select Register

![Alt text](images/Create%20azure%20app%20registration%202.png)

### Create a Client Secret

- Select Certificates and Secrets
- New Client Secret
- Provide a description and select add

- Add an Azure Subscription Account
    1. Name the account Azure-Onion-Containers
    2. Fill in the Subscription ID
        i. This can be found in the Subscription Overview page in the Azure web portal
    3. Leave the Authentication Method as 'Use a Service Principal'
    4. Fill in the Tenant ID
        i. This can be found in the Overview page of the App Registration in the Azure web portal
    5. Fill in the Application ID
        i. This is the Application (client) ID from the App registration that was just created. This can be found in the Overview page in the Azure web portal
    6. Fill in the Application Password / Key

# Octopus Deploy Environment Setup:

In Octopus Deploy create 3 environments.

- TDD
- UAT
- Prod

No Deployment targets need to be created.

Create a Lifecycle that uses those three environments promoting from TDD -\> UAT -\> Prod

# Octopus Deploy Project Setup:

## Connect Octopus to GitHub

### In GitHub

Create a Personal Access Token with repo access only.
Save the token for use in Octopus

### In Octopus

Create Git Credentials using the GitHub Personal Access Token

## Create a new Version Controlled Project:

1. Create a new project, ensure the "Use version control for this project" box is checked
2. Use the Lifecycle that was just created

![Alt text](images/new%20version%20controlled%20project%201.png)

3. Click Save AND CONFIGURE VCS

      1. Skip the "How do you intend to use this project" popup
4. Set the Git Repository URL to the URL of the forked repo
5. Use the Library Git Credentials that were created earlier

![Alt text](images/new%20version%20controlled%20project%202.png)

7. Click CONFIGURE and push the initial commit to convert the project

## Create and Update Project Variables

In the Octopus Project navigate to Variables -\> Project

- Create a variable named **DatabasePassword** Set the values to Sensitive and enter passwords for TDD, UAT, and Prod environments
- Update **registry\_login\_server** to the login server of the Azure Container Registry that was created
  - This loging server can be found in the Overview page of the container registry in the Azure Web Portal
- Update **EnsureEnvironmentsExist** to True for Prod/UAT to ensure that all resources will be created the first time.

Optional:
- Update **ResourceGroupName** and/or **container_app_name** to names that match your naming convention. If the TDD values are changed, the TDDResourceGroup and/or TDDAppName variables in Azure DevOps, or the **TDD_RESOURCE_GROUP** and/or **TDD_APP_NAME** variables in Github Actions must be changed to match.

6. Provide the personal access token from Azure DevOps as the Feed Password

![Alt text](images/add%20feed%20to%20octo%202.png)

## Create the Library Variable Group

1. In the Azure DevOps project: Go to Pipelines -\> Library

![Alt text](images/variable%20group%201.png)

2. Create a variable group named **Integration-Build**

    1. Create a variable called **FeedName**. The value will be \<Azure DevOps project name\>/\<Azure DevOps feed name\>
    2. Create a variable called **OctoProjectGroup** with the value being the Project Group that houses your Octopus Project.
    3. Create a variable called **OctoProjectName** with the value being the name of your Octopus Project.
    4. Create a variable called **OctoSpace** with the value being the name of your Octopus Space.
    5. Create a variable called **TDDAppName** with the value equaling the Octopus **container_app_name** variable TDD value. default is tdd-ui
    6. Create a variable called **TDDResourceGroup** with the value equaling the Octopus **ResourceGroupName** variable TDD value. default is onion-architecture-dotnet-7-containers-tdd

![Alt text](images/variable%20group%202.png)

3. Save the variable group

## Grant the pipeline access to the variable group

1. From the variable group page select the Pipeline permissions tab at the top
2. Select the hamburger menu, and select Open Access

![Alt text](images/variable%20group%203.png)

5. Select Approve & Install to allow Azure Pipelines to connect to GitHub
6. When reviewing the pipeline YAML select **Run** to create and run the Pipeline for the first time

![Alt text](images/pipeline%203.png)

The pipeline will build the application, create all of the resources in the TDD environment, deploy the app to TDD, test the app, then destroy the TDD resources. Then the Azure resources in UAT will be created, and the app will be deployed to TDD. Ultimately Prod resources will be created, and the app will be deployed to Prod

# Github Actions Setup:
